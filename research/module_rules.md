# Shared rules resolver

`tools/rules.mjs check|explain|read --repo PATH --task NAME --file ROOT_RELATIVE_PATH`
discovers the target Git root, checks the instruction adapters and submodule, validates
metadata, selects rules and optionally returns their canonical text. Tasks/files repeat.
`--only ID` bounds one read without changing the selected scope.
The executable is a small error boundary; `tools/lib/rule-cli.mjs` owns the CLI protocol.
Missing npm dependencies fail with the locked installation command rather than an unhandled
module-load stack trace. PROJECT's optional `requires` metadata names mandatory root-relative
documents, checked for existence and included in the source manifest.

`tools/lib/rule-catalog.mjs` owns task vocabulary, YAML validation, glob matching,
dependency expansion, source hashes and payload budgets. It uses `yaml` (ISC) and
`picomatch` (MIT), exact versions in `package-lock.json`, installed with lifecycle scripts
disabled. These capabilities were absent from the existing tools; a second custom YAML
parser or glob engine was avoided. Existing lexical path validation is reused from
`tools/lib/paths.mjs`, supplemented with real-path checks for instruction sources.

Metadata keys: `id`, `load`, optional `paths`, `tasks`, `depends`. Unknown fields/tasks,
duplicate ids/keys, empty bodies, missing dependencies and cycles are errors even in
unselected rules. All Markdown in the four rule directories must declare metadata.
Local rules use the same schema and `local.*` ids. The migration inventory records every
original rule section and body hash; it is historical evidence, not a second selector.

Limits: 2 KiB metadata per file, 256 KiB per source, 256 sources / 4 MiB catalog,
16 KiB always core (including its dependency closure only), 256 KiB manifest,
32 KiB canonical text per read, 64 tasks and 256 file arguments per scope. Overflow fails
explicitly. The resolver does not persist artifacts and therefore has no retention job.

Consumer SHA verification compares the actual checkout to the index gitlink and reports
the HEAD pin separately. A staged migration is named as staged, not as committed. A dirty
mounted source fails; source-repository development is explicitly labelled working-tree mode.
Global/managed instruction policy is not visible to this process. `resolved` means source
selection succeeded, not that an agent read or complied with it.

Equivalent dot segments and repeated separators are normalized before glob matching;
parent traversal remains rejected. Scoped override detection has a separate ancestry walk.
Integration tests can inject an installed source root through the internal module API;
the executable accepts no root override. This lets coverage observe the real CLI protocol
without changing the resolver's pinned-submodule contract.

Sonar S4036 is treated as a false positive for this developer CLI's constant `git` executable:
the operator owns PATH and the process runs with the same identity, without privilege transfer.
Task and repository inputs are passed only as arguments. The scoped analyzer exclusion and
its rationale live in `sonar-project.properties`; it does not cover arbitrary process calls.

The S1 review found a root-target loop: `--file .` started ancestry at the parent and
never reached the repository again. Directory-like targets now fail validation and ancestry
also has a filesystem-root guard. The CLI regression was observed timing out before the fix.

## The subagent-model rule and the guard that enforces it (2026-10-13)

`common/subagent-models.md` (10 377 B) maps a subagent's role to a model alias: scouts and coders `sonnet`, judges
`opus`, the epic split, security judgements and cornerstone specs `fable`. Its `tasks` name fourteen tasks and
deliberately omit `inspect`, `ui`, `gpu` and `storage`, whose single-read scopes it would push past 32 768 B;
`tools/rules.test.mjs` enumerates `TASKS` and pins both halves of that split, so a new task must be placed by a person.
`common/planning-docs.md` carries the epics-and-stories layout the rule's pipeline refers to.

Where the rule is not loaded, the guard carries it. `settings/hooks/subagent-model.mjs` is a `PreToolUse` hook on
`Agent|Task`: a launch whose `model` is exactly `sonnet`, `opus` or `fable` gets a one-line role digest as
`additionalContext` and no permission decision; anything else in a well-formed call is denied with a fixed reason that
opens with `subagent-models.md:` and carries the table, and (guard v2) a launch that sets `effort` to anything but `high` is denied with a short reason after the model check; a malformed payload, a throw or a stalled stdin fails open.
`SUBAGENT_MODEL_GUARD=off` silences it for harnesses that measure models. Its `ROLE_DIGEST` is its only copy of the
table, compared with the rule's own table by `tools/lib/role-table.mjs` in the test suite.

The guard reaches a session three ways: `settings/settings.json` wires it for consumers (`adapter-check` demands the
copy), this repository hosts it on itself in `.claude/`, and `tools/install-user-hook.mjs` (`--install`, `--uninstall`,
`--check`, `--force`) puts it into `~/.claude` through `settings/hooks/lib/user-guard-install.mjs` — refusal on
unparsable or concurrently changed settings, a backup, an atomic write, one handler upgraded in place. A second
`SessionStart` hook, `settings/hooks/ensure-user-guard.mjs` (5 s timeout), runs that core at session start when the
user copy is missing, older by `GUARD_VERSION`, or badly registered; it never downgrades, never runs from this
repository's own layout, refuses a project copy with uncommitted changes, and writes a provenance manifest. The same hook, at EVERY start, converges an existing `~/.claude/settings.json` so `effortLevel` and every
`modelSettings.*.effortLevel` (`sonnet`, `opus`, `fable` and any other key) are `high` — backup and atomic write, silent
when already converged, skipped under `SUBAGENT_MODEL_GUARD=off` and in this repository (the `subagent-model.optout` marker does NOT skip it: high everywhere), never creating the file, following a symlink and keeping the file mode, refusing (one warning line, nothing written) a read-only file, an unwritable target, or a non-object `modelSettings` / per-model value
(`applyEffort`; `install-user-hook.mjs --check` reports it without gating the exit code). Design
record: [PLAN_subagent_model_tiers.md](PLAN_subagent_model_tiers.md); its release to the consumers is recorded in
[PLAN_subagent_model_tiers_rollout.md](PLAN_subagent_model_tiers_rollout.md).
